Proxmox VE Installation & Setup Guide
Purpose

This document explains how to install Proxmox VE on a physical server, configure networking and storage, and handle common issues during installation. It’s written for labs and server environments.

1. Prerequisites
Requirements
Item	                             Description
Proxmox VE ISO	            Download from https://www.proxmox.com/en/downloads
Bootable USB tool	    Use Rufus or BalenaEtcher
Server Specs	            4+ cores CPU, 16GB+ RAM recommended
Network	                    Static IP available
Disks	                    At least one dedicated physical disk for Proxmox
Internet Access	For repository updates

2. Creating the Bootable USB

Insert a USB pendrive (min. 4GB).

Open Rufus → select Proxmox ISO.

Partition scheme → GPT, Target system → UEFI (recommended).

Click Start.

##Important: After you create the bootable Proxmox USB, it becomes unreadable in Windows.
Don’t panic it’s normal. Proxmox uses a Linux partition format, and Windows cannot read it.
You can reformat it later to FAT32 if needed.

3. Booting and Starting Installation

Plug in the USB to your server.

Boot and press F8/F11/F12 (boot menu key depends on manufacturer).

Select your USB drive and start Install Proxmox VE.

4. Installation Steps
Step 1: Accept License

Just accept the EULA and continue.

Step 2: Select Target Hard Disk

Choose carefully depending on your setup:

Scenario	                          Recommended Disk  	                                File System	            Notes
Single large disk (e.g. 7TB)	Use that disk	ext4 (LVM-Thin)	Best performance

Two disks (unequal sizes)	Install on smaller (e.g. 2TB), add larger (e.g. 5TB) later	ext4 for both	Use 2TB for OS, 5TB for backup

Two equal disks	                Use both in ZFS RAID1	  					ZFS	   	Redundant setup, needs 16GB+ RAM

Tip: ZFS is powerful but uses more RAM. For labs and lightweight use, ext4 is perfect.

Step 3: Country & Timezone

Select your country, timezone, and keyboard layout.

Step 4: Set Root Password & Email

Choose a strong root password.

Enter a valid email address (used for system alerts and updates).
Example: admin@yourdomain.com

Step 5: Configure Network

You must set a static IP.

Field	Example
Management Interface	enp65s0f0 (detected automatically)
Hostname (FQDN)	proxmox.lab.local
IP Address	192.168.1.10
Netmask	        255.255.255.0
Gateway  	192.168.1.1
DNS Server	1.1.1.1

Important:

Always use a static IP, not DHCP.

Proxmox Web UI depends on this IP.

Avoid using the same IP as other devices.

Step 6: Install

Click Install and wait. The installer will partition the disk and install all necessary packages.
After a few minutes, it will prompt you to reboot.

After reboot, remove the USB pendrive — otherwise it might boot into installer again.

5. First Login

Open browser → go to
https://<your-ip>:8006
Example: https://192.168.1.10:8006

Login:

Username: root
Password: <your-password>


Accept the SSL warning (self-signed certificate).

6. Post-Installation Configuration
6.1 Proxmox-helper script for post installation

bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/community-scripts/ProxmoxVE/main/tools/pve/post-pve-install.sh)"


6.2 Add Additional Storage (Optional)

Add it in Proxmox GUI:
Datacenter → Storage → Add →

7. Common Issues During Installation
Problem						Cause	               			Solution
USB unreadable in Windows		Linux partition used by Proxmox		Reformat USB after installation
Boot fails after install		USB still inserted			Remove USB and reboot
“No network interface found”		Missing NIC driver			Use latest ISO or add driver manually
Web UI not opening	       		Wrong IP or port			Use https://<IP>:8006
Repository error	       		Enterprise repo without license		Add no-subscription repo/use post installation proxmox helper script
Low performance				ZFS with low RAM			Use ext4 if RAM < 16GB

8. Recommended Settings for Best Performance
Component	Recommendation
Filesystem	ext4 (unless using ZFS RAID)
VM Storage	LVM-Thin
Disk Cache	Writeback (if supported)
CPU Type	Host
BIOS		OVMF (UEFI)
SCSI Controller	VirtIO SCSI
Network		VirtIO
